### Offensive Security
The first large area within Cyber Security is the offensive side. This area involves attacking different applications and technologies to discover vulnerabilities.

**This career benefits greatly from the following skills:**
-  Understanding how things work
-  Analytical thinking
- Thinking out of the box

The most common offensive security job role is a penetration tester. A pentester is an individual that is legally employed by an organisation to find vulnerabilities in their products, this usually requires a broad range of knowledge including, but not limited to:
- Web application security
- Network security
- Use of programming languages to write various scripts

>More recently, cloud security has also been gaining popularity as various organisations are now shifting their infrastructure to cloud providers such as AWS and Azure.

### Defensive Security
This is the second major area within Security. While Offensive Security involves actively finding vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within technologies, Defensive Security involves detecting and stopping these attacks.

**This career benefits greatly from the following skills:**
- Analytical thinking
- Problem-solving

One of the careers under this track is a Security Analyst. This is an individual in an organisation who's job is to monitor various systems and detect whether any of them are being attacked. To do this, you need to understand how underlying technologies work and then understand what attacks against these technologies look like.

While this is a very specialist role, malware analysis is quite common when detecting and responding to attacks. Malicious actors would use malicious pieces of software in any stage of their attack cycle from gaining access to a system to maintaining persistence. If you can understand what exactly this malware is doing, you can prevent further abuse and also identify the malicious action.
