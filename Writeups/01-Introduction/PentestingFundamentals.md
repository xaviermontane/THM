## What is Penetration Testing ?
Before diving into the hands-on technical aspects of ethical hacking, you'll first have to understand more about what a pentester's job responsibilities are and what procedures are followed in performing pentests (finding vulnerabilities in a client's application or system).
<br><br>
Cybersecurity has never been as important and relevant as it is today. News headlines fill our screens, reporting yet another hack or data leak. Cybersecurity is relevant to all people in the modern world, including a strong password policy to protect your emails or to businesses and other organizations needing to protect both devices and data from damages.
<br><br>
A penetration test, or pentest, is an ethically driven attempt to test and analyze security defenses to protect assets and pieces of information. A pentest involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use. Through these techniques, we, as pentesters, are responsible for creating an audit with recommended steps to further protect said assets and sources of information.
<br>
> According to Security Magazine, a cybersecurity industry magazine, there are over 2,200 cyber attacks every day - 1 attack every 39 seconds.

## Penetration Testing Ethics

The battle of legality and ethics in cybersecurity, such as those of penetration testing, has always been controversial. Labels like "hacking" and "hacker" often hold negative connotations, especially in pop culture, which has been perpetuated by the attacks of malicious actors. The concept of legally gaining access to a computer system is challenging to grasp, but what makes it legal in the first place?
<br><br>
Keep in mind that a penetration test is an authorized audit of a computer system's security and defenses as agreed upon by the system's owners. The legality of pentesting is pretty clear-cut, as anything that falls outside of this agreement is deemed unauthorized. Before a pentest begins, it's paramount that a formal discussion occur beforehand between the pentester and the system owners. Various tools, techniques, and systems to be tested are agreed upon. This discussion will then shape the scope of the pentesting agreement and set the direction of the test.
<br><br>
Companies that offer penetration testing services are frequently held to legislative standards as well as industry accreditation. For example, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has the _CHECK_ accreditation scheme in the UK. This means that only _CHECK_ accredited companies can conduct authorized penetration tests of public sector and _CNI_ systems and networks (NCSC).
<br><br>
Pentesters will often face potentially morally questionable decisions during a penetration test. For example, if they're gaining access to a database and being presented with potentially sensitive information, or if they are, perhaps, performing a phishing attack on an employee to test an organization's human security, as long as that action has been agreed upon during the initial stages, it is legal, despite how ethically questionable it may be.
<br>
#### Authors Note
We must not forget that we are humans who are tempted to do evil, but as ethical hackers, we must focus on having a strong character as well as a strong moral compass so that we are not sidetracked by the job's temptations. As discussed in the previous lesson, hackers are divided into three main "hats" (white, grey, and black), and as pentesters, we must aim to stay within the white hat category (or at least during working hours...)
<br>
### Rules of Engagement (ROE)
Now we'll take a look at the ROE. This is a document that is created during the initial stages of a pentesting agreement. This document consists of three main sections (explained below), which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out. The SANS institute has a great example of this document, which you can view online [here](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/bF4I3yCcnt/?).

| Section | Description |
| ------ | ----- |
|  Permission | This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals or organisations from the activities carried out. |
| Test Scope | This portion of the document will designate specific targets that should be addressed by the engagement. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network. |
| Rules | The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay. |

## Penetration Testing Methodologies

For many years, security verification used to require a cross-disciplinary specialist who was knowledgable of the operations, processes, and technologies involved. Sometime later, third-party verifications arose from the notion of builder blindness, which argues that those closest to the target will generally and usually involuntarily miss the most problems. Therefore, security testing methodologies were developed to outline the steps taken during a penetration test. 
<br><br>
A practical methodology is a smart one; this would entail taking the relevant steps for the situation at hand. However, it's important to note that certain methodologies might fall short or be incorrect, depending on the scope of the engagement. Just like our previous lesson, penetration tests have a generalized approach for engagement; this general structure is also known as [The Hacker Methodology](THM/Writeups/01-Introduction/HackerMethodology.md):

| Stage | Description |
| ------ | ----- |
|  Information Gathering | This stage involves collecting as much publicly available information about a target/organisation as possible without engaging with the system, for example, OSINT and research. |
| Enumeration/Scanning | This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable. |
| Exploitation | This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered in a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic. |
| Privilege Escalation | Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator). |
| Post-Exploitation | **This stage involves a few sub-stages:**<br><ul><li>Identifying vulnerable hosts (pivoting)</li><li>Additional information that can be gathered from the host now that we are privileged</li><li>Covering your tracks</li><li>Reporting</li></ul> |

### OSSTMM

Now we'll be delving into the various industry-standard methodologies, with the first one being the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM), which provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications, and the human aspect of cybersecurity.

**The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems and applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:**

1. Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)
2. Wired Networks
3. Wireless communications

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ------ | ----- |
| Covers various testing strategies in-depth. | The framework is difficult to understand, quite complex, and tends to use unique definitions. |
| Includes testing strategies for specific targets (I.e. telecommunications and networking) |
| The framework is flexible depending upon the organisation's needs. |
| The framework is meant to set a standard for systems and applications, meaning that a universal methodology can be used in a penetration testing scenario. |

### OWASP

Another quite known framework is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), which is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services. The OWASP foundation regularly writes reports that state the top ten security vulnerabilities a web application may have, the testing approach, and remediation.


| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ------ | ----- |
| Easy to pick up and understand. | It may not be clear what type of vulnerability a web application has (they can often overlap). |
| Actively maintained and is frequently updated. | OWASP does not make suggestions to any specific software development life cycles. |
| It covers all stages of an engagement: from testing to reporting and remediation. | The framework doesn't hold any accreditation such as CHECK. |
| Specialises in web applications and services. |

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a framework used to improve an organization's cybersecurity standards and reduce the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a highgly popular one popularity as well as providing a detailed guideline. The framework provides guidelines on security controls and benchmarks for success geared toward organizations with critical infrastructure (power plants, etc.) all through to commercial. The NIST framework also provides a limited section on a standard guideline for the methodology a pentester's should take.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ------ | ----- |
| The NIST Framework is estimated to be used by 50% of American organisations by 2020. | NIST has many iterations of frameworks, so it may be difficult to decide which one applies to your organisation. |
| The framework is extremely detailed in setting standards to help organisations mitigate the threat posed by cyber threats. | The NIST framework has weak auditing policies, making it difficult to determine how a breach occurred. |
| The framework is very frequently updated.	| The framework does not consider cloud computing, which is quickly becoming increasingly popular for organisations. |
| NIST provides accreditation for organisations that use this framework. |
| The NIST framework is designed to be implemented alongside other frameworks. |

### NCSC CAF

The Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.
The framework applies to organisations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes. 
<br><br>
**The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:**
- Data security
- System security
- Identity and access control
- Resiliency
- Monitoring
- Response and recovery planning

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ------ | ----- |
| Framework backed by a government cybersecurity agency. | The framework is still new in the industry, meaning that organisations haven't had much time to make the necessary changes to be suitable for it. |
| This framework provides accreditation. | The framework is based on principles and theories and isn't as direct as having rules like some other frameworks. |
| This framework covers fourteen principles which range from security to response. |

## Black box, Grey box and White box Penetration Testing

There are three primary scopes when testing an application or service. Your understanding over the target will determine the level of testing that you perform in your penetration testing engagement. In this section, we'll cover these three different scopes of testing.

### Black-Box Pentesting
This type of testing is considered a high-level process in which the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service. The tester acts as a regular user by testing the functionality and interacting with the application or piece of software. 
<br><br>
This testing involves interacting with the interface, i.e. buttons, and testing to see whether the intended result is returned, anything that does not work as intented will become valuable information. It's important to note that no knowledge of programming or understanding of the programme is necessary for this type of testing.
<br><br>
> Black-Box testing greatly increases the amount of time spent understanding the target's attack surface during the information gathering and enumeration phase.

### Grey-Box Pentesting
This testing process is the most popular for pentesting operations as it is a combination of both black-box and white-box testing processes. In this scenario, the tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software. Still, they will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-block scenario, by using their knowledge of the application the tester will try and resolve issues as they find them.

The greates quality of Grey-Box testing is that all the information gathered before will save us a lot of time during the reconnaisance process, this means that Grey-Box systems will often have extremely well-hardened attack surfaces.

### White-Box Pentesting
Considered a low-level process, White-Box pentesting is often done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. The tester will then test the internal components of the application while piecing togewther software, for example, ensuring that specific functions work as intended within a reasonable amount of time.
<br><br>
The tester will have full knowledge of the application and will be aware of its expected behaviour, and thus making it much more time consuming than Black-Box testing. In the other hand, the full knowledge in a White-Box testing scenario will ensure that the entire attack surface can be validated.

## Closing Remarks
I want to give my thanks for all those that have been following along with the lessons, I understand that at this point there's lots of new information and not a lot of practical exercises but this is the way we as cybersecurity professionals can level up our skills, and which better way than having a strong grasp of the fundamentals, the following lesson will focus on Linux, at this point I would recommend setting up a study space in which you can follow along with the different systems we will be touching upon.
<br><br>
With nothing else to be said I hope you all continue learning about such a complex yet interesting field of technology, like I explained earlier in the writeup, cybersecurity has never been as crucial as today, and with the advent of technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and quantum computing we're reaching a crucial point of technological progress, therefore (and I can't stress this enough), we need more people like YOU, those that care for the security of systems and have a strong and deep-rooted passsion for technology as any other nerd like me ;)

**_Good luck in your studies, and remember... have fun!!_**
